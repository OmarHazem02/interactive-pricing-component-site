## Overview
This project helped me strengthen my front-end development skills by combining **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to build a responsive and interactive pricing component.  



Through this project, I learned how to:
- Make a website more **accessible**.
- Improve my **workflow efficiency**.
- Create and optimize a **range slider**.
- Manage **responsive layouts** with media queries.
- Write cleaner, more maintainable code.

I'm looking forward to learning more and applying these skills in future projects!


### The Challenge

Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for their device’s screen size.
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements.
- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers.

## My Process

I started by carefully analyzing the design and breaking it down into sections to decide what should be handled by CSS and what needed JavaScript.  
Then, I built the structure with semantic HTML, styled it with clean and responsive CSS, and finally added interactivity using JavaScript.  

### Built With

- Semantic **HTML5** markup  
- **CSS custom properties**  
- **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid**  
- **Responsive design** techniques  
- **Animations and transitions**  
- **Vanilla JavaScript**

### What I Learned

While working on this project, I practiced:
- Using `input[type="range"]` and dynamically updating UI with JavaScript.
- Creating adaptive layouts using Grid and Flexbox.
- Improving accessibility and responsiveness.
- Optimizing workflow and debugging with Chrome DevTools.

### Continued Development

I want to keep improving my:
- JavaScript logic and DOM manipulation skills.  
- CSS animation and transition design.  
- Accessibility and semantic HTML practices.

### Useful Resources

- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) – Helped me understand specific syntax and improve structure.  
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) – Great reference for HTML, CSS, and JS best practices.
